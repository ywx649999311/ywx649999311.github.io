[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"I am a Physics Ph.D. student at Drexel University, working under the supervision of Prof. Gordon T. Richards. I study Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), which are believed to be powered by super-massive black holes living at the center of massive galaxies. At the moment, my primary research focus is the development of a new AGN classification algorithm for future large astronomical surveys like the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). In the mean time, I employ stochastic modeling, in particular, the continuous-time autoregressive moving-average (CARMA) process, to investigate the physical properties of AGN accretion disks from the light curves. After all, I am always interested in applying modern machine learning techniques to tackle challenging problems introduced by ever-growing data set in astronomy.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":1591412358,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://ywx649999311.github.io/author/weixiang-yu/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/weixiang-yu/","section":"authors","summary":"I am a Physics Ph.D. student at Drexel University, working under the supervision of Prof. Gordon T.
